Recent class work


1. Simulate a tic-tac-toe game by randomly filling an integer array with 0,1,2  or a char array with  ‘’,’X’,’Y’ to represent the tic-tac-board.  Analyze the array, or board, to see if X won by having 3 in a row. Then analyze for O winning. If neither X or O wins, then there is no winner. Play 1000 games, and print out the number of Player X wins, Player O wins, and there is no winner.

2. Modify the above to add a strategy for X and Y as below:
a. No strategy, random placement – this is the above part 1
b. Have X move in the center space for every game.
c. Have O move in the center space first, for games where X does not randomly move there first.

Print out the strategy and the number of X wins, X losses and ties.
